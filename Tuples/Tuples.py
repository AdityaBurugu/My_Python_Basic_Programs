###Learning the Concepts of Tuples
#Creating a Tuple
Numbers = (21,36,14,23,23)
print('Numbers :',Numbers)
#Accessing Values in Tuple
#Accessing only element from the Numbers Tuple
print('Output :',Numbers[1])
#Accessing Multiple Values at a time from the Numbers Tuple
print('Output :',Numbers[1:])
#Accessing a value in a Reverse[Negative] Order in the above Created Tuple
print('Output :',Numbers[-2])
#Let's try to find how many an element is being repeated in Numbers Tuple
print('Output :',Numbers.count(23))
#Let's try to find out the Number of Elements in Numbers Tuple
print('Output :',len(Numbers))
#Let's try to find out the Maximum value in Numbers Tuple
print('Maximum Value =',max(Numbers))
#let;s try to find out the Minimum value in Numbers Tuple
print('Minimum Value =',min(Numbers))
